# Portfolio Website
This website is developed to showcase some of the projects that I'm currently working on as well as those done in the past. It is based on a free template from Colorlib with modifications/additions made suited to my purpose.

## Sources
1. [Website Template](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/transcend/)
2. Images are picked from various sources on the web as well as some where it showcases the actual snapshot of my work (in case of simulators). 
In case of any copyright infringement, kindly raise an issue on this repository and I would remove it.
3. All the work presented in the portfolio is done by me individually or as a part of a team.
